You’re the richest person alive. Gold still works in electronics, still makes jewelry, still has industrial uses. Its value persists even when no one else holds any.</p> <p>Now imagine you own all the Bitcoin in the world. Surprisingly, you have nothing. With no buyers and no sellers, price simply cannot exist. The premise of decentralization collapses, and Bitcoin itself becomes meaningless.</p> <p>Same monopoly, radically different outcomes. Why? And what happens when we extend this to dollars, government bonds, corporate bonds, stocks, and NFTs?</p> <p>This essay offers a unified answer to one question: “When one entity holds all of an asset, how does the world push back?”</p> <hr> <h3 id="the-core-idea-the-world-has-an-immune-system-against-monopoly">The Core Idea: The World Has an Immune System Against Monopoly</h3> <p>Every asset derives its value from some kind of network. Land depends on the community living on it. The dollar depends on the U.S. economic system. Bitcoin depends on the consensus of its participants. When a single entity monopolizes an asset, the very network that gives it value is threatened, and the network reacts to preserve itself.</p> <p>Whether it’s revolution, regulation, or a fork, the forms differ but the function is identical: <strong>the network resists what would kill it.</strong></p> <p>Let’s call this resistance a <strong>“consensus reset”</strong>: the act of breaking old rules and writing new ones. Every reset comes with a cost. The size and structure of that cost varies completely depending on the type of asset, and that variation determines whether the world’s pushback takes the form of violence, legislation, or simple indifference.</p> <hr> <h3 id="two-lines-of-defense-prevention-and-surgery">Two Lines of Defense: Prevention and Surgery</h3> <p>We can think of economic responses to monopoly as falling into two broad layers.</p> <p><strong>The first is prevention.</strong> Mechanisms that stop monopolies from forming in the first place. Antitrust laws, progressive taxation, or multiple companies and research institutions competitively releasing open-source AI models before any single player can lock down the ecosystem. Think of it as a vaccine.</p> <p><strong>The second is surgery.</strong> When prevention fails and a monopoly is already entrenched, the system forcibly overturns the existing order to survive. The French Revolution, court-ordered corporate breakups, Bitcoin hard forks.</p> <p>This essay focuses on the second layer. What happens when prevention has already failed.</p> <hr> <h3 id="when-does-it-blow-the-cost-of-enduring-vs-the-cost-of-changing">When Does It Blow: The Cost of Enduring vs. The Cost of Changing</h3> <p>The public accumulates costs from enduring a monopoly. Housing so expensive that young people give up on starting families. A platform so dominant that innovation stalls. These pains compound over time.</p> <p>On the other side sits the cost of changing. Revolutions risk lives. Legal battles take years. Moving to a new cryptocurrency requires everyone to coordinate simultaneously.</p> <p><strong>The moment accumulated pain exceeds the cost of changing, the system ruptures.</strong> This rupture doesn’t come gradually. Nothing happens for a long time, then everything happens at once. Like water at 99 degrees Celsius is just hot water, but at 100 it suddenly becomes steam.</p> <p>Two variables matter here.</p> <p>The first is <strong>the structure of the “cost of changing.”</strong> We can decompose it into two parts: the technical cost of building an alternative (copying code, developing new land) and the social cost of actually moving people’s minds (convincing all Bitcoin users to switch chains). Copying Bitcoin’s code is free. Moving its users is nearly impossible. This distinction is everything.</p> <p>The second is <strong>the “planning horizon.”</strong> Someone who buys real estate thinks 30 years ahead. The integral of their pain can grow enormous. Someone who buys a memecoin thinks days ahead. Even a small accumulation of pain makes them leave immediately.</p> <hr> <h3 id="asset-by-asset-same-monopoly-different-explosions">Asset-by-Asset: Same Monopoly, Different Explosions</h3> <h4 id="level-1-land-and-real-estate-the-slowest-most-violent-reset">Level 1. Land and Real Estate: The Slowest, Most Violent Reset</h4> <p>Imagine someone buys up every apartment in a major city’s most desirable district. Replicating that environment somewhere else is effectively impossible. The transit infrastructure, the cultural institutions, the network effects of density took decades or centuries to form.</p> <p>So people endure. But when housing insecurity compounds over 10, 20, 30 years, the accumulated anger eventually breaches the critical point. The explosion takes the most primal form: <strong>physical violence or forced seizure</strong>. The French Revolution and post-war land reforms across Asia can be read through this lens.</p> <p>But it doesn’t always succeed. Multiple Latin American countries attempted land reform, only for ruling elites to deploy military force to artificially raise the barrier to change even higher. The system remained permanently trapped.</p> <h4 id="level-2-the-dollar-government-bonds-and-corporate-bonds-resetting-by-rewriting-the-ledger">Level 2. The Dollar, Government Bonds, and Corporate Bonds: Resetting by Rewriting the Ledger</h4> <p>Suppose a massive entity hoards all dollars in existence and paralyzes circulation. The central bank doesn’t storm the vault. It simply prints more dollars (quantitative easing). Existing dollars melt via inflation, and the monopoly dissolves automatically.</p> <p><strong>Government bonds follow the same logic.</strong> If one entity bought up all U.S. Treasury bonds to dominate the bond market, the Treasury would simply issue new bonds. A sovereign government is uniquely capable of creating its own debt. The monopolist’s market power gets diluted by fresh issuance. In extreme cases, the government can renegotiate debt terms (restructuring) or refuse to pay altogether (default). This is a systemic reset achievable by editing numbers in a ledger.</p> <p><strong>Corporate bonds work slightly differently.</strong> If an entity bought up all bonds issued by a specific company to control its debt structure, the company can issue new bonds to refinance (roll over) existing debt, or bypass the bond market entirely through bank loans or equity issuance. In the worst case, bankruptcy proceedings legally restructure the bondholder’s claims by court order. The cost of changing is higher than for sovereign debt (a company can’t print money), but the reset is still possible through legal and institutional mechanisms.</p> <p>The dollar, government bonds, and corporate bonds can all be grouped under the same pattern: <strong>“rewriting the ledger and the rules to bypass the monopoly.”</strong> The difference is how much authority the rule-rewriter holds. Central bank (dollar) &gt; sovereign government (treasury bonds) &gt; corporation (corporate bonds). As authority weakens down this chain, the cost of changing rises.</p> <h4 id="level-3-corporations-and-platforms-break-them-or-go-around-them">Level 3. Corporations and Platforms: Break Them or Go Around Them</h4> <p>Imagine a single Big Tech company monopolizes all GPUs and AI models. Replicating that infrastructure overnight is hard. The system responds in two ways. One: the government uses antitrust law to forcibly split the company (the Standard Oil case). Two: the market creates alternatives like open-source models that erode the monopoly’s value.</p> <p>The interesting path is what happens when the reset fails. In the late 1990s, the U.S. Department of Justice filed an antitrust suit against Microsoft over its IE monopoly. The trial court ordered a breakup in 2000, but the appeals court reversed that order, and the case ultimately settled with behavioral remedies rather than structural separation. Yet the public didn’t fight head-on. They simply migrated to mobile, an entirely new paradigm, and IE’s dominance became irrelevant. <strong>When you can’t break through the wall, you walk around it.</strong></p> <h4 id="level-4-bitcoin-free-to-copy-impossible-to-move">Level 4. Bitcoin: Free to Copy, Impossible to Move</h4> <p>Copying Bitcoin’s code to create a new chain is technically almost free. But the brand and network effect of “the original Bitcoin” can’t be copied. Bitcoin Cash fell into exactly this trap. The fork itself was easy, but people didn’t follow. The technical cost was zero, but the social cost was insurmountable.</p> <h4 id="level-5-memecoins-and-nfts-the-fastest-coldest-reset">Level 5. Memecoins and NFTs: The Fastest, Coldest Reset</h4> <p>Someone buys up an entire famous NFT collection to manipulate scarcity. The public doesn’t revolt, doesn’t sue, doesn’t fork. They just stop caring. “Oh, that’s their private collection now.” With zero cost, they redirect their attention to another project, and the billion-dollar pixels instantly become worthless.</p> <p>This is the most efficient and most brutal form of reset. No anger, no fight, just indifference.</p> <hr> <h3 id="the-big-picture-why-these-differences-exist">The Big Picture: Why These Differences Exist</h3> <table> <thead> <tr> <th style="text-align: left">Asset</th> <th style="text-align: left">Cost of Changing</th> <th style="text-align: left">Planning Horizon</th> <th style="text-align: left">Form of Explosion</th> <th style="text-align: left">Speed</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td style="text-align: left">Land / Real Estate</td> <td style="text-align: left">Extremely high</td> <td style="text-align: left">Decades</td> <td style="text-align: left">Revolution, seizure</td> <td style="text-align: left">Decades</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: left">Dollar</td> <td style="text-align: left">Medium (can print)</td> <td style="text-align: left">Years</td> <td style="text-align: left">New issuance, inflation</td> <td style="text-align: left">Months</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: left">Government Bonds</td> <td style="text-align: left">Medium (can re-issue)</td> <td style="text-align: left">Years</td> <td style="text-align: left">New issuance, restructuring, default</td> <td style="text-align: left">Months to years</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: left">Corporate Bonds</td> <td style="text-align: left">Medium-high</td> <td style="text-align: left">Years</td> <td style="text-align: left">Refinancing, bankruptcy</td> <td style="text-align: left">Months to years</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: left">Corporations / Platforms</td> <td style="text-align: left">Medium (rule change)</td> <td style="text-align: left">Years</td> <td style="text-align: left">Antitrust breakup, paradigm migration</td> <td style="text-align: left">Years</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: left">Bitcoin</td> <td style="text-align: left">Tech: low / Social: high</td> <td style="text-align: left">Months</td> <td style="text-align: left">Hard fork (usually fails)</td> <td style="text-align: left">Weeks to months</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: left">Memecoins / NFTs</td> <td style="text-align: left">Near zero</td> <td style="text-align: left">Days</td> <td style="text-align: left">Indifference</td> <td style="text-align: left">Instant</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>The takeaway is simple. <strong>The lower the cost of changing, the faster a monopoly collapses. The higher the cost, the longer it endures before ending in a bigger explosion.</strong> And the structure of that cost is determined by whether the asset is physical, institutional, or digital.</p> <hr> <h3 id="what-this-tells-us">What This Tells Us</h3> <p><strong>First, we can estimate when the explosion is coming.</strong> If a monopoly is building in some market, compare the “accumulated public pain” against that system’s “cost of changing.” When pain approaches cost, change is imminent.</p> <p><strong>Second, we can distinguish real moats from fake ones.</strong> When investing, ask whether an asset’s “dominant position” sits on a foundation of high changing costs, or on fragile ground the public can abandon at any moment. The scarcity premium on NFTs is a mirage built on a surface where the cost of changing is zero. Real moats exist only on foundations of high effective reset cost.</p> </div> </article> <br> <hr> <br> <ul class="list-disc pl-8"></ul> <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-12">Enjoy Reading This Article?</h2> <p class="mb-2">Here are some more articles you might like to read next:</p> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2026/Consensus-Reset-Cost-Theory-ko/">합의 리셋 비용 최적화 이론</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2026/Speak-Concisely-Write-Verbosely/">Speak Concisely, Write Verbosely</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2025/The-gentle-singularity/">The Gentle Singularity</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2024/Deep-seek-interview/">DeepSeek: A More Extreme Story of Chinese Tech Idealism</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2021/Exploiting_Contemporary_ML/">Exploiting Contemporary ML</a> </li> <div id="giscus_thread" style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;"> <br> <script defer src="/assets/js/giscus-setup.js"></script> <noscript> Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://giscus.app/?ref_noscript" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">comments powered by giscus.</a> </noscript> </div> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2026 Wonjae (Dan) Kim.
