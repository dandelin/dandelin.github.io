I am a research scientist at <a href="https://naver-career.gitbook.io/en/teams/clova-cic">Naver AI LAB</a>.
Prior to joining Naver, I worked as a research scientist at <a href="https://www.kakaocorp.com/?lang=en">Kakao</a>.
I completed my <a href="http://hcil.snu.ac.kr/people/wonjae-kim">M.Sc.</a> and <a href="https://cse.snu.ac.kr/en">B.Sc.</a> in computer science and engineering at Seoul National University.

I am interested in the following research topics:
