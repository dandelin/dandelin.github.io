Hi! I am research scientist at <a href="https://www.kakaocorp.com">Kakao corporation</a>. 
I completed my M.Sc. and B.Sc. in <a href="https://cse.snu.ac.kr">computer science and engineering</a> at Seoul National University.

I study anything that is necessary to connect humans and machines more closely; I am interested in the following research topics for that:

- Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)
- Interpretable neural models
- Acquisition of semantic concepts from raw data
  - Vision: Detection and Segmentation
  - Language: LM and various downstream tasks
  - Both: Cross-modal retrieval, VQA, Dense captioning
